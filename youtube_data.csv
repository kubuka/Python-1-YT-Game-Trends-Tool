Xal did not betray anyone. She made the promise to defeat Dimensius and she did just that. There was ZERO promise beyond that.\n\nAnd again: if anyhing, than Alleria betrayed Xal first, when she laughs about her fate to be imprisoned in the Dark Heart. \n\nWithout Xal the player characters, Alleria and Co would have had zero chance to win.\n\na) Only by Xal they were able to get that energy form which was needed to get even in the mana forge to confront Dimensius. Before that, even standing outside of this was lethal.\nb) During the fight Xal saves the player characters and make them able to continue to fight.\nc) During the fight, Xal beats down Dimensius and without that there would have been no chance to win against him.\n\nAll this led to the point where Xal seems to be captured in the Dark Heart with Dimensius and all Alleria got for this sacrifice is a satisfied chuckle and that this is a deserved fate, with no care to free her 'ally' who is the sole reason that reality still exists, from this fate."", ""Xal is good in manipulation, because she is not lying - she's just not telling the whole truth and what she gains from it.\n\nPeople fall for that all the time."", 'It\'s more likely than ever that Alleria is just a puppet for Xal, a puppet with an own will, but still dancing on the strings.\n\nEven the damaging of the Dark Heart could likely all be Xal\'s doing, since where did this bring Alleria and Co? To the point where they can not say not to Xal\'athas. \n\nShe smirks, because this is 100% clear. They could even have the ability to see the future and know that this will end in Xal getting the Dark Heart back and kill one or all of them, but they still NEED her to defeat Dimenesius or be devoured.\n\nXal got exactly what she wanted, the situation she loves most, when others NEED HER, so she got all the power over them.\n\nSure, she could have just given the Dark Heart to the Shadowguard, but this would not have the same effect. The way it worked out instead gave most of the blame to Allerdia, since she damage the Dark Heart, her doing led to Xal losing it and by that landing in the hands of the servants of Dimensius.\n\nAnd Xal rubs this in: ""YOU broke my Dark Heart.""  = ""It\'s all YOUR fault. If all reality dies, then only because you fought me.""\n\nThat\'s also what drives Alleria insane.', ""Xal'atath is a Spacemancer; she wields Space Magic at a level unseen by any other being in all of Warcraft lore.  It is very likely she is older than the Titans by a LONG Time."", 'Ah man just had to remind me of that god-awful, absolutely terrible Arathi storyline. And so does Blizzard every time I go to get my weeklies.', ""Since you were listening to the Whispers of K'aresh secret audio, it makes me wonder - have you listened to any of the other audio offerings that WoW has to offer? The novellas that are free on their YouTube channel read by Metzen & others, of the audio-drama for WoW: Legion? They might be fun things for you to do, whether on or off stream."", ""99'99% sure Xal is facing Lor'themar on the teaser and I don't like his odds... Just when he gets married to Thalyssra too ü§£ Blizz really does love killing Horde leaders..."", ""1:18:50 The Soul-Scribe's sacrifice strengthened and saved K'aresh'es Worldsoul, and Worldsouls empower their planet's inhabitants. With Dimensius gone (from K'aresh atleast), both the Worldsoul and planet (or what's left of it) can start healing."", 'I like how Phil seems always genuinely happy and excited to go through these cinematics and being a part of the community. Seriously with all the negative people out there who down this game its just really nice to see the enthusiasm i still feel about this long standing game', 'The music is ome of the best parts of the game. It really brings the atmosphere together. I can literally just spend time walking or flying around enjoying the environments sometimes', ""Watch Sylvanas come back and redeem herself to help Alleria take out Xal'Atath in the coming expansion or 2. She's goin to run out of souls to release from The Maw eventually."", ""Didn't get the notification for the live (and I generally can't watch it all because of the time difference anyway), so I'm catching up now. Stupidly excited to see the Midnight reveal tomorrow!"", ""1:05:40 If they had not allied with Xal'atath, Dimensius would have fully manifested in our universe and destroyed not only Ka'resh, but all of creation. Ka'resh was doomed either way ‚Äî but now he survived because of everything that happened, including the alliance with Xal'atath. Maybe there was another way to save their world. We'll never know for sure."", ""Locus Walker might not be dead. Khadgar ended up in the Dark Heart, its theorized that most of Dalaran is in the Dark Heart. Locus Walker and Xal'atath could have transfered places. The bandages eroded because they were protecting him and had to be destroyed before he could get sucked up. What gets me is that Locus Walker is supposed to be the wise teacher. He taught the Void Elves how to handle the Void. Yet he freakin' falls for Xal's trickery, knowing full well she was going to do something? What is that?"", 'I will allways love your Wow reactions <3']"
