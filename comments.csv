Partial VOD gang (I'm always amused when I fall asleep to a stream and wake up to...a stream ) It's been a lot of fun watching you play WoW! I played when I was younger so it feels super nostalgic, though I dunno if I have the strength to pick it back up again 
Hope you rest well and see you next stream! ",0,2025-07-17T07:45:07Z

11,@metalchick5296,"Thank you for such a fun stream, Im so happy Zerpents are getting invested in a game that I grew up on almost all my life as a gamer! I loved helping talk about the lore and hearing your stances on each story! Hearing you talk about something you love so much makes me so happy, and I bet others feel the same way too! I may be Alliance aligned, but I'll always happily be your Zerpent. I can't wait to hear about other things you also enjoy too, and patiently await a fun WoW fishing stream with everyone one day.
